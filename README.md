World_Weather_Analysis

Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to demonstrate the weather data across the cities, so the travelers can determine their destination based on weather to the cities they decided to visit. In our scenario, four cities in California - [Half Moon Bay, Pacific Grove, Lompoc, and La Presa]. 
We've created a random set of 2000 latitude and longitudes and an API key to get the real weather data for those cities.
